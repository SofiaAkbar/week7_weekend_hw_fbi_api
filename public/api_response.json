The couple never married and in June of 2001 the relationship ended. The two became embroiled in a very lengthy and aggressive custody-visitation dispute in the San Diego Family Court. In early November of 2004, the mother reportedly mentioned to the father that she and the children were planning a 2-week vacation in New Zealand. He told her that the trip would violate the court orders, and Fernandez's attorney was served with a notice of an ex-parte hearing scheduled for November 8, 2004.  At the hearing, a judge ordered that neither parent could take the children out of the jurisdiction of the court and that the children's passports were to be relinquished. The passports were never returned. Also, in November it was reported that Fernandez abruptly left her job and a relative filed a missing person's report for her. Fernandez may have fled with her children to the Philippines.<br /><br />On December 9, 2004, a state warrant was issued in the state of California, San Diego County, charging Francina Dacanay Fernandez with three counts of child abduction. A federal arrest warrant was subsequently issued on February 4, 2005, in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, charging Fernandez with international parental kidnapping.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Just before midnight, a vehicle stopped on the street near the parking lot.  A suspect or suspects exited the vehicle and fired multiple shots at the group. Evelin was shot and died early in the morning of June 19, 2020.  A friend was shot and survived. </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Evidence suggests this was a gang-motivated shooting, however, there is no indication that Evelin and/or her friends were gang-affiliated. </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The charges relate to the actions by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to target Iranian dissidents. The regime views these dissidents as enemies of the state because of their criticism of the regime’s human rights violations, and their public statements against the Iranian Government. Since at least approximately 2019, the Government of Iran has allegedly lured several expatriate Iranian dissidents to locations where they were arrested or kidnapped and sent to Iran for imprisonment and execution.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The men also allegedly conspired to kidnap and/or lure a United States citizen, as well as victims residing in other countries. They allegedly hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance on an individual in furtherance of a plot to kidnap or harm the victim based on their anti-regime activism. Noori allegedly facilitated payments to a private investigator in the United States in furtherance of the kidnapping plot.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>In July of 2021, Noori, Farahani, Khazein, and Sadeghi were indicted in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, on the charges listed above and federal warrants were issued for their arrests</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
